### Purpose
glmmSeq is designed for the classification of DNA sequences produced in metagenetic and metagenomic applications. The software can be trained to classify sequences from any genetic locus and, so far, results indicate that it is highly generalizable accross markers with variable genetic characteristics (e.g. sequences from plant ITS2, plant rbcL and arthropod COI). The current version of the code is undergoing beta testing.
