Sequence classification with generalized linear mixed models

GLMM clearly applicable to issue of sequence classification
problem of overfitting with other classifiers

desirable framework with respect to limitting the potential of overfitting and explicitely modelling log odds of classification sucess

CV binomial outcomes ~ predicted confidence
test robustness to overfitting (acc ~ db size)
compare to SINTAX
